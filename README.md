## Project path
- [] Add a reject method that changes the postâ€™s state from PendingReview back to Draft.
- [] Require two calls to approve before the state can be changed to Published.
- [] Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the Draft state. Hint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the content but not responsible for modifying the Post.
